Automated Build and Publish Process for Spring Boot and React Applications
Project Overview
This project automates the build and publishing process for a Spring Boot backend and React frontend to GitHub’s npm registry using GitHub Actions. The integration enables smooth, continuous deployment while ensuring secure and efficient handling of version control, authentication, and error management.

Key Features
GitHub Actions Workflow: Automates the process of building the Spring Boot backend and React frontend, followed by publishing the frontend package to the npm registry.
Spring Boot Backend: Automates the build process for the Spring Boot application, ensuring the backend is efficiently compiled and ready for deployment.
Frontend Packaging: Publishes a TypeScript Axios package, allowing for easy integration with the backend API.
Node.js and npm Integration: Installs npm dependencies and automatically bumps the package version to ensure users always access the latest updates.
GitHub Authentication: Uses GitHub tokens to securely authenticate and publish packages, enhancing the security of the CI/CD pipeline.
API Integration: Enables the React app to fetch data from the Spring Boot backend using the published npm package, ensuring dynamic and real-time data interaction.
Robust Error Handling: Implements strong input validation and error management to enhance the user experience and ensure application stability.
How It Works
GitHub Actions Setup:
The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to automate building the backend and frontend, followed by publishing the frontend package to GitHub’s npm registry.

Backend (Spring Boot):
The workflow builds the Spring Boot backend using Maven, ensuring it is packaged for deployment.

Frontend (React + Axios):
The frontend application, built with React, is packaged and published to the npm registry using TypeScript Axios. The workflow installs npm dependencies and automatically bumps the package version.

Secure Publishing:
The GitHub token is used as a secret to securely authenticate and publish the npm package, ensuring safe package management.

API Integration:
The React app fetches data from the backend API, using the npm package created during the build process.

Error Management:
The workflow handles input validation and error management, ensuring a seamless user experience across the application.

Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
bash
Copy code
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Build the Spring Boot project
mvn clean package
Frontend Setup (React + TypeScript Axios)
bash
Copy code
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend server for local development
npm start
GitHub Actions CI/CD
Create a GitHub token with the necessary permissions to publish to the npm registry.
Set up the .github/workflows folder for GitHub Actions and add the appropriate configuration files for building and publishing.
On each push to the main branch, the action will automatically build, bump the version, and publish the package.
Environment Variables
Ensure to set up the following environment variables in your repository:

GITHUB_TOKEN: GitHub token for authentication during publishing.
DATABASE_URL: URL for your Spring Boot backend database.
Usage
Frontend: Fetch data from the backend by importing the published npm package.
Backend: Serve data to the frontend and manage API requests.
